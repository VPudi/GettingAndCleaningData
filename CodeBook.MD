The data set contains data for each of 6 Activities performed by 30 Subjects(Persons):

Following are the Columns of the Tiday Dataset:


"ActivityName" VARCHAR - Indicates the type of Activity undertaken by the subjects:
	WALKING, 
	SITTING, 
	LAYING, 
	STANDING
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

"Subject" - Numeric value indicating the PERSON who performed the Activity. 1-30 People performed the 6 Activities:

For the Following Variables:

t - indicates the time domain signal

f - indicates frequency domain signals obtained by applying a Fast Fourier Transform FFT

mean - indicates average value 

std - indicates Standard deviation value

meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency 

XYZ - indicate 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions

BodyAcc - indicates the body acceleration signal

GravityAcc - indicates gravity acceleration signal

Jerk - body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals

Mag - indicates the magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
